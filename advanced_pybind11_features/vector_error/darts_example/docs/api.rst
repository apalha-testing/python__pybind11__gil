.. Generate doc from docstrings of python code.

.. automodule:: model_outside
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :inherited-members:

.. The pybind module
   Have to be called build.vector_error because vector_error.so is placed in build.
   This renders the doc with the module named `build.vector_error` instead of
   simply `vector_error`.
   Such behaviour could be avoided in a (real) code by
   setting TARGET in main file to the package folder.

.. automodule:: build.vector_error
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :inherited-members:
